                    my mission is simple: make technology an asset for your business not a problem. Too many times we have seen other IT consulting firms recommend solutions that are not appropriate for the specific client’s business or will not take a business’ operations into their planning as they routinely bring down an entire business while they perform routine maintenance on a server. That is unacceptable. We won’t bring you down in the middle of the day because it is “a better time for us”.
